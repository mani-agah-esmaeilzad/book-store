# Online Bookstore API

This project is an online bookstore system built with **C#** and **ASP.NET Core**. The goal of this project is to provide APIs for managing books, categories, authors, customers, orders, payments, reviews, and more. It uses **JWT** for authentication and has features for payment processing, coupon discounts, and email notifications.

## Features

- **Book Management** (Add, Remove, Update, View Books)
- **Category Management** (Add, Remove, Update Categories)
- **Author Management** (Add, Update, View Authors)
- **User Management** (Admin & Customer roles)
- **Order Management** (Create, View Orders)
- **Payment Processing** using Stripe
- **Discount Coupons** (Add and Apply Coupons)
- **Reviews & Ratings** for Books
- **JWT Authentication** (Secure APIs)
- **Email Notifications** (Sendgrid for registration & purchase confirmation)
- **Search & Filter** Books

## Prerequisites

Before setting up and running this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET SDK** (version 6 or higher)
- **Visual Studio** or any code editor (like VS Code)
- **MySQL** or **MariaDB** database server
- **Stripe API Key** for payment processing
- **SendGrid API Key** for sending emails

## Installation

### 1. Clone the project

To clone the repository, run the following command:


```
git clone https://github.com/username/bookstore-api.git
cd bookstore-api 
```
2. Install Dependencies
To install the required NuGet packages, run:
```
dotnet restore
```

3. Configure Database

The project uses MySQL or MariaDB for the database. Create a new database called bookstore. Then, update the connection string in the ``` appsettings.json ``` file:
```
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Database=bookstore;User=root;Password=yourpassword;"
}
```
4. Configure Stripe and SendGrid API Keys

You need API keys for Stripe (payment processing) and SendGrid (email service). Add your keys to the ```appsettings.json ``` file:

```
"Stripe": {
  "SecretKey": "your_stripe_secret_key",
  "PublishableKey": "your_stripe_publishable_key",
  "SuccessUrl": "https://yourwebsite.com/success",
  "CancelUrl": "https://yourwebsite.com/cancel"
},
"SendGrid": {
  "ApiKey": "your_sendgrid_api_key",
  "FromEmail": "your_email@example.com"
}
```

5. Create Database and Tables

To create the necessary database tables, use the following commands:

```
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the required tables based on your model.

6. Run the Project

To run the project, execute the following command:
```
dotnet run
```
The application will run on ``` localhost:5000 ``` for development purposes.

Using the API
1. Authentication (JWT)
To use most of the APIs, you need to authenticate using a JWT token. You can get a token by logging in.

Register (Create Account):
http
```
POST /api/auth/register
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "username": "newuser",
    "password": "password123"
}
```

Login (Get JWT Token):
To log in and receive a JWT token, send the following request:

```
POST /api/auth/login
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "username": "newuser",
    "password": "password123"
}
```
You will receive a JWT token on successful login.

Sending the Token in Requests:
For any request that requires authentication, include the JWT token in the ```Authorization``` 

header:
http
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```

Authentication (JWT)

The response will include a JWT token, which you can use to authenticate other requests.

Sending the Token:

For any request that requires authentication, include the ```JWT token``` in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN
```
Testing the API

You can test this API using tools like Postman or ```Swagger```. Hereâ€™s how you can start:

Postman:

Import the Postman collection available in the repository.

Make sure to include the JWT token in the Authorization header when testing protected routes.

Swagger:

Swagger can be set up to document and test the API interactively. You can access Swagger UI by running the project and navigating to ```http://localhost:5000/swagger```.
Unit Tests:

You can also run unit tests to ensure that the API and its logic are working as expected.

To run unit tests, execute the following command:
```
dotnet test
Troubleshooting
Common Issues
```

Database connection failed:

Ensure your ```MySQL/MariaDB``` server is running and check the connection string in appsettings.json.

If you're using Docker for the database, ensure the container is running and accessible.

JWT Authentication failed:

Ensure that the JWT token is included in the Authorization header with the correct prefix (Bearer).

If using JWT_SECRET from environment variables, check that the value matches what is configured in your app.

Stripe Payment Issue:

Double-check your Stripe API keys and ensure they are correctly configured in appsettings.json.

Invalid Coupon Code:

Ensure that the coupon code is valid, not expired, and has been added in the system.
